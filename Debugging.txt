This project has been developed with SharpDevelop 4.2. To successfully build and debug the project, take care of those things:

1. Set Net Profiles mod as startup project in SharpDevelop.

2. SharpDevelop only supports debugging of x86 code, select the x86 platform when debugging on x64 systems.

3. If Net Profiles mod is not installed, the service for applying IP settings via named pipe will be missing. In this
   case run the PipeServerTester without the debugger (will trigger an UAC dialog). Otherwise applying IP setttings
   will fail.

4. If Net Profiles mod is not installed, it will create a the folder structure in the ProgramData folder with different
   permissions for the profiles folder than the installer. This will allow users to modify (but not delete) profiles.
